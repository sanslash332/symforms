A Small test application write using symfony 2.8.
Is in a very early stages of development and works a test of concept for a small dinamic forms application.

The idea is that a powered user can create various templates of form, and next any registered user, can create answers for any of these templates, answering the questions on that template with only three options. Yes, no or not apply.

Finally the user can get a small graph with the answers that He gave. And of course, can review and check results or grafs of any preview form that was answered.

But... for now, the application can only manage (with crud hugly pages) the templates and their questions.
